This plugin provides a shortcode to display a gallery of Dittytoy ditties on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Dittytoy Gallery allows you to display a collection of "ditties" generated by Dittytoy. With a simple shortcode, you can fetch and show external images without uploading them to your own server.

Features include:

* Shortcode-driven galleries.
* Columns and layout configuration.
* Ability to limit how many images/ditties to show.
* Option to hide the original creator's username.

= External Image Notice =

This plugin loads images directly from Dittytoy's external servers.

== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/dittytoy-gallery directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress "Plugins" screen directly.
* Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
* Add the `[dittytoy-list query="ditty/browse/love/"]` shortcode (or any other query) to your posts or pages to display a Dittytoy gallery.

== Usage ==

Insert the `[dittytoy-list]` shortcode wherever you want the gallery to appear.

Example:

`[dittytoy-list query="ditty/browse/love/"]`

To show only ditties from a specific user:

`[dittytoy-list query="user/USERNAME/love/"]`


== Optional Attributes ==

* query – Required. The query term or user filter.
* columns – Optional; default=2. Number of columns (1, 2, 3, or 4).
* limit – Optional; default=0 (unlimited). Maximum number of ditties to show if set > 0.
* hideusername – Optional; default=0. Set to 1 to hide the ditty's username.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the Dittytoy API to fetch a list of all ditties that are displayed in the gallery.

It sends the optional arguments of the short code to perform the query.
This service is provided by Dittytoy: [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://dittytoy.net/terms).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are images loaded from an external source? =

Dittytoy Gallery is designed to hotlink images from an external API and avoid storing them locally. This keeps your WordPress Media Library clean and ensures you always display the latest images from Dittytoy.

= Does this plugin store any images or data on my server? =

No. We do not store any images locally, nor do we collect personal data.
